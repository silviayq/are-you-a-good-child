Are You a Good Child? – A Cultural Logic Simulator

The design process began with a personal and cultural question: What defines a “good child” in the eyes of traditional Chinese parents?

As someone who grew up within that cultural framework, I decided to turn this sometimes humorous, sometimes stressful experience into an interactive quiz. The aim is not only to entertain but also to reflect on the rigid linear expectations many young people face.

I started by mapping a typical path of perceived “success” — elite university → graduate school → high-paying stable job → approved marriage → childbearing — and broke it down into 8 sequential yes/no questions. From a design perspective, I wanted the interface to feel playful, yet also ironic. The aesthetic was inspired by doodles and notebook-style scribbles, visually representing the pressure of being constantly evaluated.

The hand-drawn images, smiley faces, and bold colors reference both childhood visuals and the emotional duality of parental pride vs disappointment.
